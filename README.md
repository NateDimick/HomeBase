# Home Base app

A local web app for personal use at home. Hosted off the same raspberry pi I use to host bots. 

## Current Features:

* @ChupEverything Settings 
* System Hardware monitor - check CPU temp and Load
* DnD Dice Roller - simulate rolling any number of dice using Random.org's random number generation, which is close to true random.
* NFL Over/Under Wager Center - use scoring data from the current NFL season to predict whether to take the over or under on any given game.
